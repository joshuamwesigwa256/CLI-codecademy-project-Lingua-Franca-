# Langua Franca - An Offline Codecademy Porject
In this project, I use my own computer to work
through the following tasks as listed in the [link](tasks.html)

### Task Group 1: Navigating the file system
This is a task group having contributions from `task 1` to `task 5` and here
I am basically practising the `pwd`, `ls`, and the `mkdir` commands

### Task Group 2: Viewing and changing the File System
This is a task group having contributions from `task 6` to `task 11` and
here, I get to practice using the `cp` command crossing multiple directories

### Task Group 3: Redirecting Input and Output
This is a task group having contributions from `task 12` to `task 16` and
here I get to practice using the commands `grep`, `sed` and `wc` but
with  **pipes**

### Task Group 4: Configuring the Environment
This is the final task group ranging from `task 17` to `task 26` and here
I get tested in the use of **aliases**, the **bash_profile** file and
environmental variables. Finally I'm also practising the markdown syntax by
 this readme file because I have just learn about markdown as well in the
 github course with codecademy
